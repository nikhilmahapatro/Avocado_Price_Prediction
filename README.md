# Avocado Price Prediction (Basic Skill Showcase)

This notebook explores avocado pricing data and builds a regression model to predict the average price based on region, type, and time. It's not an end-to-end production system â€” the goal is to demonstrate data handling, exploratory analysis, and basic modeling competence.

> Predicting avocado prices using cleaned market data, simple regression models, and time-aware validation.

### ðŸ”§ What it does
- Loads and explores real-world retail avocado sales data  
- Cleans and preprocesses for modeling  
- Encodes categorical features like region and type  
- Builds and evaluates a basic regression model (Linear Regression)  
- Uses time-aware train/test splitting to avoid leakage  
- Sets up a foundation for expanding with better models later
